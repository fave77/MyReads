# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

**MyReads** is an online book tracking web application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

> “It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it.” ― Oscar Wilde

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- **Continue**
- **Wishlist**
- **Finished**

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. The main page also has a link to a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

###### Installing and Launching the application

In order to run this application on your local machine, you need **Node.js** and **npm** (comes along with Node.js) already installed. Now, open your terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and follow the below steps:

First, clone this repository by typing the following command on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/pbiswas101/MyReads
```
Next, navigate to the project repository i.e. **MyReads** folder like so; `cd MyReads`

Then, type `npm install` which will install all the neccessary packages for running the application locally.

Finally, type `npm start` which will automatically open the application on your default browser. Otherwise, you can navigate to `localhost:3000` for running it on a different browser!
